# odin-recipes
Welcome to Odin recipes! This is a project created as part of the Odin Project Foundations Course.

## Project Description
Odin recipes is a simple recipe website where I will be showcasing my favorite recipes.


## Skills Demonstrated
 Used unordered lists <ul></ul> within ordered lists <ol></ol> to better structure content.

 Utilized <b></b> tags to emphasize and bold specific text elements.
 example: `<b>Prepare Ingredients:</b>`
 enhances the visual presentation of important information on the recipe sites.
